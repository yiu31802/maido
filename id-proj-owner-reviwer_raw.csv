Deferring the concept of propagating LogdBufferElement::log status until after the klogd adjustment where this problem becomes more serious. Also, this is an _experimental_ idea of enforcing __android_log_is_loggable on _all_ applications; inert for now, but the policy could change to consider DEBUG the default rather than VERBOSE. Thus pending approval of this concept."

_this_ is the blacklist mechanism, that will allow us to suppress specific tags from logging. The _next_ patch is a companion and is required to make sure that there is minimal impact (72ns on repeating tags, 400ns on new ones) of less than 1/2 a syscall. All the cycles taken will be at BATCH priority so should defer the impact from the caller(s)."

Thanks Ying, agreed. My hope in the long term is that cutils/atomic.. can go away and be replaced by std::atomic. So defining ANDROID_SMP won't be necessary. We can go and check TARGET_CPU_SMP uses after that too."

test case is simple.
play music > Pause > observe the condition of the control block. (don't resume)
Unfortunately, the reproducibility is very poor.
This deadlock issue is rarely reproduced in automated stability test.


So, I temporarily added short sleeping time around line 214 to increase reproducibility.
(line 214: int32_t old = android_atomic_and(~CBLK_FUTEX_WAKE, &cblk->mFutex); )

1. While the thread is activated between line 115 (after checking CBLK_INTERRUPT) and line 220 (before syscall) of AudioTrackShared.cpp

2. the thread has been interrupted by pause()

3. then a deadlock has occurred."

I would like to try what you are saying,
but I need a little more information.

To make the bug happen more often,
do you add a sleep before or after this line?

And then is there anything else you have to do,
in order to make the bug happen (besides call pause) ?"

Both before and after line 214.
I have jest tested on Nexus5 L after insert usleep(500*1000) between line 215 and 216.
ANR didn't occur on Nexus5, but the control block is at a deadlock.
Paly/Pause/Prev/Next does not work because ~AudioTrack() was not completed.

> And then is there anything else you have to do,

There is no complex pre-condition but all kind of pause.
play music > pause > observe the condition of the control block.
Please, don't press resume button right after pause() is executed."

Tested on mantaray, occam, flo - camera's not totally stable on any of them - mantaray has a frequent random breakdown (also seen very infrequently on lmp-dev, somehow more frequent on AOSP), and flo/occam both die if you try to take a picture (b/18317554). 

Dumpsys on all devices seems fine.

Mone of the above look like Binder issues, so I'm going to merge this, if only to unblock sorting out the rest of the issues."

such as audio_utils,
we could keep our endian tests.  But it sounds like we don't need

Note that these are already part of the public API in the current NDK releases.

That's only an issue when building against an updated AOSP version of the NDK, and then attempting to run on 5.0 though.
Binaries built against the 5.0 version of the NDK will continue to work, because they have these strings compiled into them.

I agree it's probably easier to just make these #defines though, so let's just do that for now. We can always consider renaming or restructuring later."

I don't think that 8KB is a reason to really keep this under GCC. It is also so close that I don't think we should spend additional time looking for optimization opportunities in such a small library. There are plenty of bigger (size/performance/...) issues for the clang transition, and we have people looking at those."

Actually is UB. I'm hoping to build ubsan for the device today, so I'll check and see that it catches this. I think the static analyzer should probably be able to catch this too.

Not much of a reason from the AOSP perspective, but I occasionally build this code standalone outside of AOSP as well, and it did build fine with e.g. pre-2013 MSVC versions, while I now noticed that it no longer built. I know that supporting such setups isn't a priority for AOSP, but in this case, keeping the code C89-compatible doesn't really cost much effort, at least not fixing it occasionally if it is broken."

I agree with you. Simply I assume that there are 2 routing commend. One have delay and the other have no delay. Originally, 2 routing commend are processed in order of delay. But, After applying this, these will be processed in order of FIFO. Overall, routing commend without delay will be blocked for a while. Of course, this is my own concern theoretically and no hard data. Plus, this is better solution than me. Therefore I will try to test for a couple of days and report if something happens."

Yes, I figured given your address, and since you control the whole OS stack for Firefox OS, I'll only mildly warn you that (as you can clearly tell) the native client-side interface here is wholly untested.  The public Java API talks directly through Binder with the camera service, so only the service-side native binder interface is used today.

This binder layer is also likely to change in the future, as there's some overdue cleanup due for the camera2 API guts.  But that may not happen all that soon. But this is considered an entirely internal interface, so no guarantees about it staying as it is."

Hi Tiger,

Thanks for the detail information on the problem.

Instead of creating new APIs, would it be better to detect this state in getOrientationFromWindowsLocked()? Better yet, we can combine methods getOrientationFromWindowsLocked() & getOrientationFromAppTokensLocked() so we only need to loop through the windows/appTokens once."

Elliott any problem with playing cache games? Remember, in liblog we do not have permissions to set properties :-(

I do not think cache will save us much in the general case, but once systems resort to setting/clearing the log.tag property in init in the name of a sped-up boot, the cache will help."

Thanks for the review, I have a benchmark, but I did not _this_ code out as I actually expect it to be roughly the same speed if nothing is set as compared to using the public interface. The goal was to improve speed _if_ we can when _something_ is set.

Your suggestion to get the global sequence made available will address _all_ the performance concerns. This will require bionic changes prior to doing this.

I may have to consider taking this out of the dependency chain for the related change for 'logd: filter...'; for this I will rerun the benchmark for the impact of _two_ unset properties and determine if I consider it negligible from the logd performance perspective."

Overhead for four cache-misses and value not-set is 1154ns (about a syscall) on a N9. For a set value, this drops to 73ns (wohooo).

For now, consider this code a prototype until the following are addressed:

Todo:
- add a mechanism in bionic to acquire the internal global sequence counter. Then add using it here.
- make this code threadsafe (either as _one_ cache-set, or as a per-thread cache-set).
- address PS3 concerns"

The liblog unit tests are in .../liblog/tests/. I make it a habit to push any additional unit tests after the main code has released; we already pushed the benchmark as part of the original release of log_is_loggable.c as that was what prompted making this caching code (results reported in PS4)."

Tidy up liblog gTest backlog to appease the review gohds, included it here. On a lark added one more series of test cases to liblog.is_loggable by setting an illegal value into the property and found a bug in the handling for global, so fixed in log_is_loggable.c :-)"

ps2 moves the other callers of BLKGETSIZE over to using the helper function, changes the signature of the helper function so that the compiler will spot type mismatches, and adds overflow checking in the FAT case. i'm not sure whether any of the other cases need to deal with overflow? (encryption looks like it was already using a 64-bit type anyway, so i think that's fine.)

jsharkey: not sure whether you'd like to go straight to BLKGETSIZE64? this patch just fixes behavior on LP64 systems, but that patch would also let you support > 2TiB drives.

Added more comments regarding the algorithm so it is clear where its weaknesses are. The weakness mutes the worst-UID in favour of simplicity and switched to the regular algorithm when the threshold is hit. It does not purely preserve 'a day', just does not allow ourselves to bend over backwards and preserve more than a day.

The major gain here is that we will not look at a phone that has an uptime of a month and see a long record of expire counts that take away from the trust one may have in the logs."

The point of this commit is to try to cleanup the unix_* vs. adb_* stuff so that future changes (and copy&paste code) are less likely to break Windows (which can't tolerate mismatches between the APIs).

An alternative to this would be to find a way to kill off unix_open(), unix_read(), unix_write(), unix_close() and just embed some logic in adb_open(), adb_read(), adb_write(), adb_close() to work on Windows with well-known file descriptors and C Runtime file descriptors.

I think that might be possible, but it might be too hacky. I figure that it is likely that you guys will rewrite all of this file business, so this is just a quick fix instead."

The test_argument_escaping and test_line_endings failures sound like your device's adbd don't have 569a1301968925f03ab2362495dd20cd23b63dba . I built adbd from source and I can get those tests to pass.

I'm not sure about test_root_unroot, can't be win32-related, right?

BTW, I'm not building an entire emulator image from scratch to save myself from a full AOSP checkout/download. I generally rebuild adbd and copy it onto a regular SDK emulator image.

Anyway, let me know what you find out and if I need to keep digging. Thanks."

d'oh! i'd spent the day testing Windows fastboot.exe with large system images, so i was running an L build!

and that L build was actually a production build, so no root/unroot."

I think the checks are too strict. what happens if ld decides to reduce alignment to 4k for arm64? Also is this compatible with ld.gold? (android currently uses ld.bfd for arm64 by default, 64k could be bfd thing not arm64 thing)"

I should probably dive deeper to confirm/deny my assertion regarding the timing for the creation of /data/misc on that crucial first boot?

on property:ro.build.type=eng
    setprop logd.syslogd logcatd

on logcatd
    mkdir /data/system/logd 0700 logd logd
    . . .
    start syslogd

To ensure that syslogd started really late so that there was no chance it could hold on to /data on an encrypted device during vold machinations. But a design changed removed the need for this feature being added here in init.

what i really want to do is fix this once and for all, so all arguments to all builtins are expanded. but i keep failing to get round to it, so i've been happily +2ing special cases as people have needed them.

(and i feel this is very similar to the 'exec' case --- we had a long history of bullshit random little hacks instead of just doing the right thing once.)

the other thing that bugs me is that that constant is wrong. yes, it's what everyone else is using, but it's wrong a${b}c can obviously be larger than the maximum length of a single property. expand_props should be rewritten to use std::string.

but, yeah, this patch is making things less bad than they were, so fine by me."

This ignores log rotation. If someone specifies ``-f /data/foo -r 5`` then the logs will be in foo.1, foo.2... is it ok to just overwrite them with older log data? Seems like the complete solution would look for the latest date in each of the rotated logs."

Agreed, rotation being interrupted can cause a problem. If interrupted by a system crash, it will work just fine (logcat -L notwithstanding) since the logs in memory will in fact continue where we left off since they have effectively been wiped by the reboot. If interrupted by logcat crashing (or being requested to stop! forgot about that one), it will not overwrite, it will replay the logs (a form of stutter) rather than continuing.

One of the complications could be that logcat is stopped with a -n 99, and then restarted with -n 999. This means the rotated files will have a different namespace (eg: /data/foo.01 before, and /data/foo.001 after). The only one we can count in in both namespaces is that /data/foo will always exist.

To handle all the complications, I decided it was better to just accept that sometimes there will be this stutter, in exchange for KISS.

I will prototype an algorithm that generically searches through all the files with the same basename (regardless of the namespace), finding the latest time and see if the code looks like a maintenance issue."

Sounds good. I think stutter when the rotation geometry is changed is reasonable unless it can be fixed easily, but it would be nice to at least cover the rotation case when the geometry doesn't change. To avoid going through ``foo.unrelated`` and ``foo.1-notalog`` it seems like you could just limit to the current namespace and ignore the old namespece files."

Switched to using libbase. Added check to deal with the fact we could see a year rollover on these logs. Incremented by the time precision so as to prevent the one-log-entry stutter we get on runtime restart. The file match not only checks if it has a trailing dot or nul; but also checks if the first character after the dot is a number (stopped short of checking _all_ characters have to be numbers to keep it in a simple if statement). Allowed -t or -T to override -f check for end of logs to preserve that existing behavior."

for background, the general technique of using /proc/PID/fd/FD file descriptors to work around limitations of O_PATH file descriptors came from the discussion at https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14578 , specifically comment #10. 

Bionic has used this technique before to implement fchmodat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW). See https://android-review.googlesource.com/127908 for the implementation."

yeah, your change won't work for files that have non BMP characters AND were created outside Java (i.e using regular UTF-8).

yeah, you can fix other parts of platform that use M-UTF8 while a lot files be modified."

I don't think that finding and fixing other parts of the platform that use non-BMP chars in files will work.

The function android_os_Parcel_openFileDescriptor use standard UTF-8 
can not open files that name encoded with M-UTF8. 

My path using GetStringUTFChars instead of String8 is just using M-UTF8 not standard UTF-8. So I believe my change will work. For supporting both ，change as below is better choice.

My point was that the system to standardize on what it uses for dealing with files and paths that it cares about (File systems don't care or specify encodings). The vast majority of code in android that manipulates these types of paths is written in Java, so it makes sense to use that. 

I'd prefer not to have code scattered everywhere that tries opening files twice (once with MUTF-8 and once without)."

Are you sure no one uses external filters (eg, awk scripts etc) and relies on the the ``uid=1234(name)`` or the ``comm=`` to parse out the name and command fields? It seems like the benefits in human readability might be offset by the loss of machine readability."

Just started discussions with the test team to parse this information.

ObligatoryDisclaimer: Sorry for the churn, explained below.

*I* was the only person doing so, this is so new that no one has likely started. This is the third format I have tried in the past 45 days ... However, the previous and ad-hoc form to quickly address the complaints about the first form of the message (which was all numbers and no names) _did_ get out into preview release and thus lit a fire under me to reset the standard now to my best foot forward or hold my peace.

What is expected is that 'logcat -S' does (or will go further to) produce the tabular information associated with these expire messages in order to get a better bearing on the chatty application(s). The chatty expire messages themselves are there to help people that are triaging determine that there is missing content in the logs; and to provide some temporal data (eg: if they get a burst every 3 minutes of dropped messages, they can spot in the unexpired logs this same burst to find out what is causing the problem). So these messages are for the humans and not those that intend to parse or tabulate the data. logcat -S has more information in its hands than the chatty messages provide."

Thanks for the great comments Dan!

I addressed all of them except the 'with' statement as it doesn't work with tf.extractfile. I got the following error message:

AttributeError: __exit__

and it seems to be similar to this post on stackoverflow:

AttributeError: __exit__"

Oops here is the stackoverflow link:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7447284/how-to-troubleshoot-an-attributeerror-exit-in-multiproccesing-in-python

And looks like our emails crossed as I found those errors and fixed them in patch set 4/5."

Please house Jiffy or HZ in a variable. By looking at the bootcharts and the known 200ms sampling rates, you can probably calculate/intuit what the HZ value really is (but that can be deferred for a later CL)."

dear sir,
ran into your change by accident. don't want to suggest a differnet change because I'm not in the code...sort of speak. but,
if you set t->sfd to be -1 although the next line can potentially crash and not be ``reflected`` in the result. perhaps you should check adb_close() status, or something? I'm not fully in the code. hope this helps.

    int fd = t->sfd;

Thanks for the review. The code By Design sets t->sfd to -1 before calling adb_close() just in case the fd causes adb_close() to crash, in which case since t->sfd was just set, no one else in the future can try to close it again (causing problems repeatedly). So in the crash case, the code By Design leaks the fd which is preferable to leaving it around to cause more problems.

But really, this change does not have real provisions for the case of arbitrary lines of code crashing since that is a very difficult (impossible?) way to program this kind of code.

I checked the rest of the codebase and the return value of adb_close() is never checked, so this change follows that convention. adb_close() is really just an alias for unix/posix close() which is often not checked in many codebases."

I'm nothing less than disappointed to learn this is the state of the code base, if this is the case (of contributors) not taking the small efforts to do the simple checks, how can we rely in the future on this platform to drive cars? 
I'm in total agreement with you on this specific change after the effort you put but I can't believe we let this go on like that....should I change to plus instead?

I'm not the component owner, so I can't speak for them, but perhaps you can describe the simple check that you're suggesting?

I'm not sure all the details of how the AOSP handles -/+, I'd advise you to check the project documentation to guide your decision.

My thinking is that larger architectural changes like this should be driven by the component owner because they're in the best position to understand their future plans for the codebase. In other words, non-component owners could prototype large changes, but it is risky if, say, the component owners are planning to do a larger rewrite or reorganization, or change to exception handling, RAII classes, etc.

Here is another example: I was thinking about cleaning up some of the logging/tracing code, but then I realized that the component owners might be rewriting all of that anyway, so any work I do (without full knowledge of their future plans) would just be wasted. So I let it be until later. Hope this helps explain where I'm coming from. Thanks."

This linker patch depends on a mips kernel patch that is not yet at aosp, sorry.

With the revised kernel, this linker patch will correctly run all kinds of mips32 programs on mips64r6.  Without the revised kernel, this linker patch will reject running on mips64r6 any mips32 program built with old compiler defaults (-mdouble-float), whether or not that program actually uses floating point.

Without this linker patch, such mips32 programs will load, and may appear to run correctly if they have little or no use of single-precision floating point values.  If they have nontrivial uses of single-precision FP values, the mips32 program will likely suffer corrupted values.

Mips32 programs recompiled with current compiler defaults (-mfpxx) will run correctly on mips64r6, with or without the kernel patch or this linker patch."

writepid is perfect; however I don't think this will work as written.

if I understand this correctly, there's a race between writing the pid and executing the service. as a result, there is a possibility that the child process may have created its own thread before the writepid is finished, resulting in that worker thread not being included in the appropriate cpuset. this is bad.

can we make the child process write its own pid instead of the parent?"

Seems fine, but are you sure you want to encode this functionality in init.rc instead of in init?  Why not have keywords to specify the behavior that you want, and then have init take care of the details?

I think more complicated cgroup policy should probably be considered device-specific for the foreseeable future. this also doesn't require us to encode a lot of policy into init. I don't think it's a burden for now, but I agree that if some basic patterns for services emerge we may want to include support for that in init directly."

This is a cleanup patch from a series of audited tests that was deferred until all other features were done.

The dmesg -T changes to use Android Time was to allow for an easier check of that, but it was rejected. Until we have the ability to take 'dmesg -T' and compare 1:1 against 'logcat -b kernel -v usec -d' automated unit tests will not occur. A wrapper for dmesg -T to perhaps simulate that has yet to be written; in time ...

And in the purest send, can not write an automated unit test without adding code to allow test-input (replace klogctl), the input comes from the kernel buffer. My unit test has been to allow a boot and multiple devices over time, then to confirm that all log lines are in their place, tested on a variety of devices to cover all the oddities that could come from the kernel. The audits so far are done visually because kernel logs do not shape well into the android logs (the content is not 1:1 exact match because of spacing rules)."

i think you misunderstand what a unit test is; your existing tests aren't really unit tests. unit tests are much smaller and more focused than this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing

that's why i said this code should be refactored. there's a ton of testable stuff here, but it's hidden in large functions that do too many things to be testable. if you're having trouble providing test input to the code you want to test, break that out into another function.

this is what i meant above --- that's not unit testing. that's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing instead.


(yes, philosophically everything's a ``unit``. i just think you could avoid far more bugs by using much smaller units :-) )

i know the code in system/core sucks, and i know historically it's had no unit tests, and i know it's hard to refactor a lot of the awful old ``global variables C programmer 1970s nightmare`` stuff we've inherited, but when you're writing new code, that's the easiest time."

My unit test is (N6 and N9) with my own private variant of dmesg (not strictly necessary, but we do need to compare timestamps too, which we do not anymore).

#! /bin/sh

Dimitry, could you please forward the contents of http://b/22045439, and the name of the mips32 programs you tried, and how that mips32 program was compiled?

I am guessing that the mips32 program failed with linker message ``Kernel or cpu failed to set FRE mode required for running ...``.

That particular issue is expected, and will resolve when we update aosp's copy of the mips kernel (alternatively, if the program is recompiled with current mips compilers).

If this test failure was some other issue, I'd like your example to work on it further.

thanks,

I was unable to reproduce the error
   Unsupported MIPS32 FloatPt ABI 6 found in ...
in my aosp repo.  That ABI 6 message would happen if debuggerd was a stale copy, ld'd from parts that included some .o piece compiled with compiler option -modd-spreg.  We now require -mno-odd-spreg in all mips32r6 modules included in mips6r6 system builds.  

I don't know how that could happen.  The -mno-odd-spreg option has been explicit in the mips32r6/mips6r6 build/core/combo/arch/mips scripts for a long time, and the current aosp mips compilers default to -mno-odd-spreg also."

The context for why the lock is required is in logd/LogStatistics.cpp (not touched in this CL) where the helpers originate. The issue is that calls to find the pidToName and pidToUid will create entries in the table if logs have not been submitted by the pid to prefill the content. pidToName, pidToUid and uidToName all read the existing table and thus could suffer issues iterating the list if it is changing."

or use a recursive mutex and just have the helpers lock/unlock automatically? (i'm assuming the current implementation is because you wanted callers who already hold the lock to be able to call these helpers.)"

Actually, I am not familiar with proper steps to bail out here.

I looked at SoftAVC.cpp, upon bad input it notifies OMX_EventError, sets a flag mSignalledError, which is checked at the very beginning of onQueueFilled.

I didn't create such a mSignalledError in SoftAVCDec.cpp, and when playing 4k content onQueueFilled would still repeatedly get called, exiting at the source location where OMX_EventError is notified. Should I?"

I am not able to reproduce this fail.I tried 4k mp4 clips and 4k ts clips. In which format are you seeing this issue. Could you upload the clip?"

Hamsalekha, are you decoding with SoftAVCDec? You can disable the hardware decoder by removing it from media_codecs.xml (and then rebooting) to ensure software decoding.

I don't think we can attach files in gerrit? I'll just add my test file to the commit in the next patch."

I have added some more fixes. Swapped port reconfig and reinit so that, port reconfig is not called in the case of error. Codec context also needs to be set to null at the beginning and when a  init fails.
I have also removed the clip you uploaded.(Google drive is what is typically used)."

I tested the patch on our internal branches; the patch addressed the initial CHECK but eventually unmasked some unexpected SEG faults/failed CHECKs. I suspected memory corruption and did indeed saw numerous invalid writes under valgrind in libstagefright_soft_avcdec.so. I didn't provide my valgrind logs because of the potential code differences, but one should be able generate similar diagnoses specific for his/her local source tree as follows:

$ cd <android root>/external/valgrind ; mm [-jXX]

$ cd <android root>/frameworks/av/cmds/stagefright; mm [-jXX]

$ adb shell valgrind stagefright <path to 4k mp4>

Hamsalekha, would you please take another look? Thanks."

I ran stagefright through valgrind and fixed all the invalid writes.However,I am still seeing crash in NuPlayer::Decoder::onInputBufferFetched . I see a similar crash even in vp9 soft decoder when create fails.

Where do you see the crash?. Please share the details with us.

Hello Hamsalekha,

With your latest patch applied on top our internal M dev branch mediaserver no longer crashes when playing 4k videos with SoftAVCDec. I couldn't share details on the crash because our internal OMX handling has diverged from AOSP.

What I will do next:

1. credit you with the authorship of the patch (the current patch still lists me as the author)

2. merge your patch in M

3. abandon the AOSP CL

Thanks for addressing the issue!"

Not sure, and don't know how to test (other than get a Mac, set it up, etc - sounds like a day of work). If a target only uses libziparchive, and not libz, then it's OK; otherwise we should add libz. Probably most or all of those don't need libz.

How about I land this tomorrow morning and keep an eye on the build server to quickly fix remaining issues? Or it would be great if someone tested a checkbuild on Mac."

Sorry, I was busy for a while. I'm fine submitting as-is, if you know that it's only the Mac you'd break..."

We don't try to build the entire OS with ASan on the desktop. This is a completely new thing.

Oh, I thought by symbolic link you meant -Bsymbolic. Yes, we can setup a symbolic (ln -s) link and read the linker name and change default paths at runtime. I'm not sure that's easier though.

I don't know how the linker works at runtime, but I am wondering if we can pass runtime option to the linker? something like:
-Wl,-dynamic-linker,``/system/bin/linker -asan``"

(3 comments)

There's some extra/missing whitespace in the code formatting (see inline comments), but I also have a concern about the implementation.

It took me a little while to figure out where the initial TP-MR is assigned. The framework sets the TP-MR byte of the PDU to 0 in .gsm.SmsMessage.getSubmitPduHead(), so the RIL is responsible for filling it in. Then we get the messageRef from the response to RIL_REQUEST_SEND_SMS and this patch sets the TP-MR byte to the same value before resending.

So my only concern is that the RIL must be careful not to overwrite TP-MR with a different value when this code path is executed. Because 0-255 are all valid values for TP-MR, the correct RIL behavior is not obvious when TP-MR is zero. I suspect that at least some vendor RILs may be assigning a value to TP-MR regardless of the value passed in the PDU. 

The correct RIL behavior would probably be to assign a new TP-MR value when TP-RD is 0, and to use the value from the PDU when TP-RD is 1. Rika, is that your understanding as well, or is there something I'm missing?

The change isn't merging cleanly into our internal tree because of some variable name changes that Wink made for consistency with Android naming conventions. It's easy enough to cherry-pick into our internal tree by updating the variable names and changing Log to Rlog, but we'll have to do that by hand."

Hi Jake, In our solution, it is actually not the RIL, but rather the WMS module in modem that looks up next TP-MR to be used from SIM @power up and supplies when TP-RD is 0.  And RIL is just a pass through.  When MO SMS failes, failed TP-MR value is propagated from WMS -> RIL -> Telephony.

What you said about ``I suspect that at least some vendor RILs may be assigning a value to TP-MR regardless of the value passed in the PDU.`` may be true, and those vendors must fix their RIL if they want this change to take effect in setting TP-RD and TP-MR correctly.

We'll fix the white spacing.

So, are you satisfied with my response or do you have any other concern?

Thanks,
Rika"

Just to be clear... So, when TP-RD is 1, TP-MR is not overwritten by WMS.  Only when TP-RD is 0, next (or new) TP-MR is assigned by WMS.

I am not sure what you meant by behavior is unknown when TP-MR is 0.  Maybe you meant when TP-RD is 0?"

I don't understand the reason for this patch: CMAS messages should be handled in CdmaSMSDispatcher.dispatchMessage() by the call to sms.parseBroadcastSms() and dispatchBroadcastMessage(message), and sms.getIncomingSmsFingerprint() should only be called when the message is not a broadcast SMS.

In fact, I recently changed cdma.SmsMessage.getMessagetype() to return MESSAGE_TYPE_BROADCAST whenever the serviceCategory != 0, to work around a RIL bug that was not setting the messageType correctly for incoming CB and SMS, so the only time that getIncomingSmsFingerprint() will be called in the current code is when the service category is 0.

So I don't understand under what circumstances the service category would be non-zero where the message would not be handled by the broadcast SMS code which does not call getIncomingSmsFingerprint(). BTW, the CellBroadcastReceiver app handles detection of duplicate cell broadcasts, and they aren't detected in the framework."

Hi Jake,

You are right... This fix doesn't apply to JB.  Question regarding your comment:  ``BTW, the CellBroadcastReceiver app handles detection of duplicate cell broadcasts, and they aren't detected in the framework.``  Tip of aosp does not have this change you are referring to.  But we did find it was part of android-4.1.1_r2 release and on.  Just want to verify that ``Fix CellBroadcastReceiver to ignore duplicate broadcasts.`` is not reverted.  It is still valid change, right?  Thanks, Rika"

That can explain what you're seeing. Sorry about the confusion."

Hi Jake,

Issue 1)
CdmaSMSDispatcher.dispatchMessage
...
  // Handle CMAS emergency broadcast messages. <-- comment says emergency
  if (SmsEnvelope.MESSAGE_TYPE_BROADCAST == sms.getMessageType())

Above if line doesn't check if mEnvelope.serviceCategory is CMAS Alert category (i.e. BearerData.isCmasAlertCategory) hence NON-emergency broadcasts such as:

3GPP2 C.R1001-H
Table 9.3.1-1. Standard Service Categories

0x0002 Administrative
0x0003 Maintenance
0x0004 General News – Local
0x0005 General News – Regional
0x0006 General News – National
0x0007 General News – International
0x0008 Business/Financial News – Local
....

Since (SmsEnvelope.MESSAGE_TYPE_BROADCAST == sms.getMessageType()) is true for all above service categories as well, NON ememrgency bc are going to CellBroadcast app as well.

Is this intentional?  Or is CellBroadcast app only meant for Emergency bc only such as CMAS?

Issue 2) If we do put a fix in CdmaSMSDispatcher.dispatchMessage to check for service category for emergency bc which will then route non-emergency bc to be displayed in Messaging app.  Then we would also need to put this fix to add service category as part of finger print otherwise non emergency bc with different service categories will be duplicated:

Please let us know if we should add fixes for those two issues.

Thank you,
Rika"

[Jake] wrote in review earlier:
BTW, the CellBroadcastReceiver app handles detection of duplicate cell broadcasts, and they aren't detected in the framework.

[Rika] But NON-CMAS broadcasts such as 0x0002 Administrative 
and 0x0003 Maintenance are also being handled by sms.parseBroadcastSms() AND being displayed in CellBroadcast app.  Is this intentional?  Aren't only emergency broadcasts/CMAS be displayed in CellBroadcast app?  Please let us know if this is intentional or is an oversight in CdmaSMSDispatcher.dispatchMessage where it checks for broadcast but doesn't check service category for CMAS."

Please change the other length readByte() to readUnsingedByte() on line 506.

Also, any readByte() which is assigning to an int should be changed to readUnsignedByte. If you don't wish to do that we'll do it internally. In additinon there are a few casts of (byte) which are assigning to integers, these casts should be removed. Specifically lines 152, 153 and 155.

Thanks for finding this bug!"

I replied about line 506

Please check the comment.

And....

I have not tested  the other casts of (byte) which are assigning to integers.

Therefore I hope that the change about any other casts (byte,int)  will be proceed internally at Google.

A few inline comments, and I would also suggest adding a corresponding encodeShiftJis() method to be called from encodeUserDataPayload(), such as:

    private static byte[] encodeShiftJis(String msg) throws CodingException
    {
        try {
            return msg.getBytes(``Shift_JIS``);
        } catch (java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException ex) {
            throw new CodingException(``Shift-JIS encode failed: `` + ex);
        }
    }

If you have any unit tests, those would be nice to add, but not a big deal because I wrote a few unit tests yesterday for this patch (in CdmaSmsTest.java in frameworks-telephony tests) which I can upload separately after we merge this one. Thanks!"
"42091","platform/frameworks/opt/telephony","Rika Brooks","Jake Hamby","2013-01-10 02:48:43.520000000","Patch Set 1:

I uploaded the unit tests that I created to verify this patch.

https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/49461/

The new unit tests require support for Shift-JIS encoding as well as decoding, which can be added to this patch in the same way that Shift-JIS decoding was added, as I mentioned in a previous comment.

Japanese characters require 2 bytes in both Shift-JIS and UTF-16, so the only benefit of Shift-JIS is that ASCII and half-width katakana characters (plus the yen symbol) are encoded in 1 byte.

In a future release, we could enable Shift-JIS encoding for messages that would benefit from it, but this will have the same problem as the Turkish (and other national language) 7-bit encodings for GSM SMS, which is that the receiving phone must support the encoding. The Turkish 7-bit tables are only enabled for encoding on Turkish SIM cards by default (or they can be enabled for a specific device build using a config property), to comply with Turkish law requiring their use. All devices can decode messages encoded with any of the national language tables, but they are only used for encoding when specifically enabled by a custom build property or the detection of a Turkish SIM card.

So the reasons that I think this patch should add an else branch to BearerData.encodeUserDataPayload() to support encoding with Shift-JIS when a UserData object is passed which specifically requests it are for symmetry and because it makes it easier to write test cases such as the ones I just uploaded. However, we shouldn't make any other code changes to enable the use of Shift-JIS for the normal code paths.

In the future, if a Japanese CDMA carrier specifically requests Shift-JIS to be enabled for encoding, we can add code to enable it under specific conditions (e.g. registered network has Japanese MCC or device has Shift-JIS encoding enabled via build property), as we did for the Turkish case."

I'm on the Android team and I agree that these translations are better. There are a lot of similar literal and incorrect Swedish translations throughout the system. Thanks for looking at this.

Bjorn Bringert: These sort of issues does indeed seem to occur  in several places. My guess is that these are automatically translated and then never reviewed or the person reviewing them doesn't know the context in which they are used.

Btw. I didn't know there were any Swedish people on the Android team. Am I correct in guessing that you don't work at the Stockholm office?

Once again, it should only take a few seconds for your Swedish linguist to verify these new translations. As you see in the previous comments though, several Swedish people from the Android team, ST-Ericsson and SonyMobile have already confirmed them so that is not strictly necessary."

Hi Björn,

I can surely look into this and pass your feedback on to our reviewer (which is always the best thing to do to check validity of a translation) but the translation I find in our translation console for ``Time on`` is ``Tid aktiverad``.
there are no instances of ``Tid funktionen varit på``.
And the same goes for ``Not in range``: the translation in TC is ``Utom räckhåll``.

It looks like there are some concerns about Swedish translation quality. Can you please loop me in those bugs so we can check on our side too? 

Thanks
Angela"

Angela: It's quite possible that this has already been fixed internally in your translation console as Baligh said was needed. Since I never got any feedback here I just assumed it was still not fixed. After all this change was submitted back in September 2012.

Since TC is an internal system I can't verify it so I'll keep this change open until the next AOSP code drop and verify it then if that's ok. If you are sure this is no longer an issue I guess I can abandon it though."
"43051","platform/packages/apps/Settings","Björn Lundén","Björn Lundén","2013-05-29 00:37:47.354000000","Patch Set 4:

Yes, there are indeed some concerns about the Swedish translation quality in general in Android. I'll loop you on the ones I find but I don't actively look for them and I set my phone to English normally, partly due to the inconsistent quality of the translations.

I think the general problem is that Android introduces many one-word strings into the translations and that these are just initially translated using Google Translate or equivilent automatic translation. Unless the person manually verifying the results is familiar with the context in which the specific translated word is used it becomes very hard to find the issues for those short translations."

Hello,

Translations are never machine-translations. They're always translated and reviewed by qualified resources. Please feel free to include me in all this kind of bugs. It would also be great if a screenshot could be provided, because it looks like we cannot find the relevant string in the translation console most of the times.

I think these specific issues have already been fixed, but I'd like to wait for Baligh to confirm. 

Thanks
Angela"

Ok, then it's just the difficulty to review short translations without knowing the proper context that is the cause of these mistranslations.

I had a screenshot showing the issues ``Tid funktionen varit på`` caused when I submitted the change but I mistakenly removed it when cleaning out old screenshots on my dropbox account and my phone runs CyanogenMod where we already merged the fix. The text string is displayed under battery stats in Settings, specifically under Settings -> Battery -> Display if I'm not mistaken.

In regards to finding the string in TC, I think you should be able to search for the id (msgid) provided in the xml-file in question.

Example: <string name=``wifi_not_in_range`` msgid=``1136191511238508967``>``Inte inom räckhåll``</string>"
"43051","platform/packages/apps/Settings","Björn Lundén","Angela Caruso","2013-05-29 21:08:23.507000000","Patch Set 4:

I've checked translation console and

1) Translation of ``Not in range`` is now ``Utom räckhåll``. Do you  think ``nte inom räckhåll`` is better than ``Utom räckhåll``?

2) Translation of ``Time on`` is ``Tid aktiverad`` 

I guess AOSP code tree is still to be updated."
"43051","platform/packages/apps/Settings","Björn Lundén","Björn Lundén","2013-05-29 21:21:36.318000000","Patch Set 4:

``Utom räckhåll`` works fine too, even though that technically is a translation of ``Out of range``. For all intents and purposes the meaning is clear and practically the same though. The key is to use the word ``räckhåll`` instead of ``intervall``.

Yes, the changes still need to be imported from TC into the AOSP source tree but it's great to hear that the submitting of these changes caused the bugs to finally be fixed.

Maybe you or someone else can also let the people who manage the android bug tracker know that they can close issues 23804 and 22608 when the new translations have been imported."

If you try to install a forward-locked app (proprietary app), it creates an ext4 image for the app storage that is then mounted under /mnt/asec, and it ends up unlabeled.  Shows up if you do an adb install -l on the apk file, but
should also show up if you install a proprietary app from the market.  Proposing some modifications to vold to support fixing this situation.  The other option would be to change
vold to pass a context= mount option when mounting the image
under /mnt/asec, in which case all files within it would be treated as having a single security context versus the much more granular approach I'm offering. Thought I would open up the discussion on this topic with the patchset. Regardless of the approach taken, the unlabeled files need to be fixed.

This patch does depend on some ext4 changes though (I9bdc8659aae7037ccebbf4464500b79b4b2f56af) since I'm not passing a file_context option around."

I agree with Fábio Silva. Let me add:
When the day is <= 12, it will cause some confusion that you have to analyze each item for a second before selecting, causing some confusion in 132 days of 365+1, and possibly a wrong choice in 12 of 365+1 days, so a total of 144 ``bad`` days out of 365+1 is not quite acceptable.

So why do we need this now and not before now?

I'm also worried that expansion of the range in RIL.java will cause issues, although maybe its known that the ranges will be small."

Hi Wink

For cdma, currently supported ID range is 0x1000 to 0x1004. I see your concern in RIL.java if range is increased in future. However, because currently supported IDs are limited, this would be a good start to enable OEM for cdma CMAS support.

See my change in https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/46887/

manager.enableCellBroadcastRange(
SmsEnvelope.SERVICE_CATEGORY_CMAS_PRESIDENTIAL_LEVEL_ALERT, //0x1000
SmsEnvelope.SERVICE_CATEGORY_CMAS_TEST_MESSAGE); //0x1004

Also, we have been supporting OEM with CDMA CMAS for a while..since gingerbread days.  Changes were uploaded to codeaurora site, but only recently we uploaded to aosp.  Jake added Cdma CMAS support from JB, but enable/disable APIs were still not supported."

Judging by a recent android-building discussion (https://groups.google.com/d/topic/android-building/4ewpJy4eQ0g/discussion) this appears to be a non-issue. Adding a few comments anyway."

So the fix seems reasonable, we didn't have AdnRecord.aidl in the source file list. As Ying said in the google groups discussion:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-building/4ewpJy4eQ0g/discussion

Its probably because we should have added a cleanspec step. 

Its also peculiar that this has not caused a problem before because AdnRecord.aidl has been missing from the beginning. Either some other build magic causes the AdnRecord.aidl to be processed or its just not needed."

Looks it was only happened while was doing incremental build as Ying mentioned.

So I uploaded another patch to fix this in CleanSpec.mk.
https://android-review.googlesource.com/48450

Which is better? AOSP can build fine with either this one or the other one fixed in CleanSpec.mk"

Hi Wink,

I have expanded the commit text per your request.  Please review and approve the change.

As noted in commit text, unless connectTimeReal is what getDurationMillis() uses to calculate call duration.  So, without the fix, UI will show call duration as zero and it looks as though UI is frozen since it stays as zero.  Similarly, fix is needed for holdingStartTime, so getHoldDurationMillis will return correct value.

Thanks,
Rika"

This looks reasonable, but please add a reference to the specification including the section/paragraph to the commit message.

Also, how did you find this, is there a test suite that failed?"

BTW, this API is only used by ``*#*#4636#*#* -> battery information``. So, how about ``return String.valueOf((float)x / 10);``?"

Some long lines need to be wrapped to < 100 chars.

I have some questions about the new ``gsm.mvno.type`` and ``gsm.mvno.item`` system properties. Are you planning to submit additional changes to AOSP to use the properties from elsewhere (like the Phone app) or is it intended for carrier customized builds?

We should add a new method in this class to set the MVNO system properties, rather than having multiple calls to SystemProperties.set() scattered through GsmDataConnectionTracker."

Yes, ``gsm.mvno.type`` and ``gsm.mvno.item`` system properties are used by Setting App (https://android-review.googlesource.com/51280)

Why can the user not modify mvno data?  For carriers without MVNO the user can modify everything to configure the connection.  Why is MVNO data special?"

Dear Roberts

 Basically MVNO key is based on carrier's policy and write it down in USIM. and then we should compare the key value in user's USIM with that of APN data. Because of that, new logic would automatically insert ``saved`` MVNO key,that saved when USIM loaded. If user added new APN with wrong MVNO data, it does not work and cannot show no more in APN list.
 And new logic is also implemented if does not exist matched MVNO key, it would list up major carrier's APNs with MCC/MNC ,without MVNO."

The current APN code is written so that the user can fix the data and regain a connection to their carrier if the carrier changes configurations.  I do not think the MVNO data should be different in this regard - if the user incorrectly enters or changes the apn db they have the potential to break their connections, but also they have the ability to fix it."

Are there mvno cases where we need spn, imsi-mask and gid data, or even 2 of the 3?  Or is the situation such that the mvno_type field dictates what 1 piece of data we need to determine an mvno match?

User can select date before 1970 or after 2036. but calendar doesn't set that date. So I proposed limitation for date from 1970 to 2036."

ah, svetoslavganov explained to me that the problem is that the system clock can't be set before 1970. could you rewrite the second sentence of the commit message to say ``However, the system clock cannot be set to a date before 1970-01-01.`` instead of ``However, Calendar is available from 1970-01-01.``? thanks!

(i'm assuming the end-2036 date is correct, even though the usual limit for 32-bit times tends to be mid-2038. If you know _why_ it's that strange date, that would be a good comment too.)"

from testing, it looks like 2038-01-18 is the last date representable by the system clock, which makes sense and means it the usual signed 32-bit int. (i was wrong earlier when i claimed the date is April. better bring my emergency evacuation plans forward a few months!)"

that wouldn't be the first time zone that isn't properly translated in Settings. i'd like to kill these translations by exposing some more icu4c API so i can have Settings do something like this instead:

 for each time zone Settings shows:
   if the time zone's country == the user's country:
     use the display name appropriate to the current time (``Eastern Standard Time``, ``Pacific Daylight Time``)
   else:
     use the exemplar city (``Calcutta``, ``コルカタ``)
     as an optional extra, i could add the translated country name too (``Calcutta (India)``).

that seems to be roughly what the _intent_ of the Settings xml files was meant to be, even if that's not actually what we ended up with.

i'd been hoping to do this for the last two weeks, but other stuff keeps coming up. maybe tomorrow..."

Thanks for the patch. I wrote the original code and I assumed that the classification of those two message ID's as ``Severe Alerts`` rather than ``Extreme Alerts`` was a mistake because the message class is the same as the severity in the other cases. 

Looking at the spec, I agree that your interpretation is correct. However, I think that getCmasSeverity() should still return CMAS_SEVERITY_EXTREME for these two types. In the CellBroadcastReceiver app, getCmasMessageClass() is used to determine whether to show the message, so that method should return ``Severe``, but when showing message details, we should show ``Severity: Extreme``. See inline comment. Everything else looks good."

Can you explain how this change affects redraw after rotate?  It looks like the only substantial change is in onClicked, which now gets the checked-state as a param, but before it was calling the UI to find the clicked state.  Was the call to isChecked giving the wrong answer?"

Thanks for your review.
Let me explain: when rotate the phone, onCheckedChanged will be called and handled checkbox status properly according by checkbox's status(checked/not checked), if set OnClickListener, onClick won't be called, rotate phone event won't be handled, you'll see checkbox is checked but the context that should be shown is gone.
So I changed listener to fix this issue.
If any question,please leave comments to me, thank you."

You can reproduce this issue as below:
Go to Wifi networks and edit a Wifi network. At the bottom of the settings check ``Show Advanced settings``. Now rotate the phone to landscape and back to portrait. The Advanced settings are now gone, but the checkbox is still checked.

Thank you very much for finding and analyzing this issue.

Your change looks reasonable, but I wonder if it would be better to clear the saved data as soon as we're done with it, ie in onCreateDialog after the ap is created from mAccessPointSavedState?"

Yes, we don't need mAccessPointSavedState anymore after Wi-Fi Access Point dialog was created from it. 

As a result, I think it's a better timing to clear mAccessPointSavedState. And the modification can also avoid same issue if  a dialog are created by the same way.

Hi JP, thank you for reviewing and sorry for the delay, I was on vacation for the past two weeks. 

I took your advice and created a new PathInfo class and also switched to using fnmatch since it was brought to my attention that we have a similar patch for ueventd (please see https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/92054/) and it is probably best to use the same matching patterns.

I will upload it shortly, after doing some testing."

Andy, thank you for your reply. No, I don't have a test case, but I do have a use case. In our company's source code, there is a use case where MediaPlayer::decode is calling MediaPlayerService::decode directly, not through a binder. (They are in the same process, for the reason of performance, somebody in our company decided to do SoundPool effect in the media server, but I'm not sure, really.)

But a binder should just be an implementation detail, right? The point of RPC is to make it like a local procedure call, now when we call it locally, we found we are closing the fd twice...

Sorry for my ill English, please feel free to contact me. Also see my inline comments."
